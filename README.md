CosmoMC module for the Eis cosmography method. + Simulated supernovae catalogues. 

The file cosmography.f90 (not available yet! updating to CosmoMC June 2016 version, use for the moment cosmography_CosmoMC_old.f90) has the modules to the code CosmoMC to fit the statefinders parameters in different methods in cosmography. As described in arXiv:1606.XXXX (or see EisCosmography.pdf in this repository)

The dirs /*SimulatedData have all the simulated catalogues used in the paper arXiv:1606.XXXX. Further statistics than those presented in the paper can be found in dir /Stats

A long table that extends Table 1 in the paper, for the 100 dispersed catalogs fits, can be found in file statefinder_marginalized_posteriors.pdf
